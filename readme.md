A simple javascript 2D game engine.

Current list of features:
 * [x] Multiple scenes/levels
 * [x] Each level with its own hierarchy of items on screen
 * [x] Item positioning and rotation inside the hierarchy
 * [x] Independent background collection attached to the scene (with parallax)
 * [x] Image preloading
 * [x] GUI elements (text, console, menus, windows/frames)
 * [x] Css fonts rendering to images (only re-rendered when text changes)
 * [x] Simple item behaviour attaching it to a tracker (bezier curves, circles, sine movement, follow)
 * [x] Particle system
 * [x] Input controller per scene (key events subscribing or checking key status in real time)
 * [x] Input combos: consecutive or simultaneous keys
 * [x] Basic touch controls for touch devices
 * [x] Clock subcriptions to wait for certain events
 * [x] Basic audio support

Tests (in separate projects):
 * [Asteroids clone](https://github.com/neverbot/okinawa-asteroids)
  Test it in https://dev.neverbot.com/okinawa.js

To do:
 * [ ] Better audio system
 * [ ] Item collections in the scene (multiple layers of items)
 * [ ] Upload more examples of how to use the engine
 * [ ] A manual/tutorial would be useful, don't you think?

I started this just to learn something about javascript, so...
 * Is the code orthodox? Maybe not, as I'm not used to most javascript coding conventions. Feel free to point anything you found or to improve it.
 * Did I learn a lot? Sure I did.
 * Does it work? Yes it does.
